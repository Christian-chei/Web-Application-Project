Trip Planner Web Application - Problem Statement

1. General Project Description 
 The Trip Planner Web Application is a tool designed to help users organize their travel plans by allowing them to create itineraries, track budgets, manage destinations, and view essential trip details in one place. It simplifies travel planning by integrating various components into a single, user-friendly interface.

2. Solution Provided 
 The application provides a centralized platform where users can:
- Set a total trip budget and monitor expenses.
- Add destinations with notes and travel dates.
- Customize their itinerary with daily plans.
- Leave reviews and upload travel vlogs for locations they visit.
- Use an intuitive interface built with HTML and CSS.

 This reduces the hassle of using multiple tools or spreadsheets for travel planning and content sharing.
3. Value Addition Provided by the Proposed Solution 
 Unlike generic planners, this Trip Planner offers an integrated budget tracker, ensuring users stay within their financial limits. The web-based interface ensures accessibility from any device. It introduces a visual and structured way to view plans, promoting clarity and convenience.

Moreover, the platform enables users to leave reviews and share their personal travel vlogs, fostering a travel community and helping future users make informed decisions based on shared experiences.
